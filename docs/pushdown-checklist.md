# Query Rewriting & Predicate Pushdown Checklist

Each item is a capability that the planner/codegen layer must implement and verify with a dedicated test.
Check off an item only when: (a) the implementation is complete, (b) a test exercises the exact
pattern, and (c) `make lint test build` passes with zero suppressions.

## Gating

This checklist is executable. Every item maps to a subtest in
`internal/conformance/` named by its id (e.g. `1.1/=`, `2.5/fan-out-detected`).
The subtest runs the real pipeline — parse → validate → plan → pushdown → codegen —
over an inline `(semantic model, query)` fixture.

- A subtest that **passes** ⇒ the box is checkable (annotated `← gate: <id>` below).
- A subtest that calls `pending(...)` is **skipped**: the rewrite/emitter is not
  implemented yet, or the query IR cannot yet express the case. Turning a box green
  is a two-step ritual: implement the behaviour, then delete the `pending()` call so
  the assertion runs.

Run the gates with `go test ./internal/conformance/... -v`. As of this commit:
**100 boxes green, 19 pending** (see the progress table at the bottom). The green
set covers the full plan-level core (Phases 0–4) plus both SQL emitters
(Phase 5 PostgreSQL, Phase 6 BigQuery): filter/pushdown (including OR /
mixed AND-OR disjunctions), join resolution and ON/composite-key rendering,
fan-out, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY (with NULLS FIRST/LAST), LIMIT/OFFSET,
SELECT DISTINCT, COUNT variants (`*`, col, DISTINCT), conditional aggregates
(SUM/COUNT/AVG of CASE), DATE_TRUNC grains, COALESCE/NULLIF, dialect-divergent
expression passthrough (identifier quoting, CAST, string concat, boolean
literals), CASE WHEN/NULL rendering, subquery/CTE emission (inline derived
tables, WITH clauses, CTE-vs-subquery selection, nested CTEs, and
predicate-pushdown into the subquery/CTE body, via `planner.Materialize`), and
fan-out-safe pre-aggregation (each metric aggregated on its own grain in an
isolated subquery, combined by a shared-dimension or cross join, via
`planner.planPreAggregated`), and semi/anti-joins via metric filters (dbt
MetricFlow's `Metric()` pattern — see `docs/metric-filters.md`). The pending
set is features that need query-IR or model extensions: self-joins (per-
reference aliases), window functions, ROLLUP/CUBE, recursive CTEs, nested
fine→coarse aggregation, UNNEST, and null-safe equality.

## 1. Filter / Predicate Pushdown

### 1.1 Simple scalar predicates
- [x] Push `WHERE col = value` below an Aggregate node (pre-filter before GROUP BY) ← gate: `1.1/=`
- [x] Push `WHERE col != value` below an Aggregate node ← gate: `1.1/!=`
- [x] Push `WHERE col > value` / `col >= value` / `col < value` / `col <= value` ← gate: `1.1/>`, `1.1/>=`, `1.1/<`, `1.1/<=`
- [x] Push `WHERE col IN (...)` below an Aggregate node ← gate: `1.1/IN`
- [x] Push `WHERE col NOT IN (...)` below an Aggregate node ← gate: `1.1/NOT IN`
- [x] Push `WHERE col IS NULL` below an Aggregate node ← gate: `1.1/IS NULL`
- [x] Push `WHERE col IS NOT NULL` below an Aggregate node ← gate: `1.1/IS NOT NULL`

### 1.2 Multi-condition pushdown
- [x] Push `WHERE a AND b` — both conditions pushed independently ← gate: `1.2/AND`
- [x] Push `WHERE a OR b` — only if the whole disjunction can be pushed (same table) ← gate: `1.2/OR`, `1.2/OR-cross-dataset-stays-above-join`
- [x] Mixed AND/OR: split conjuncts, push each independently where safe ← gate: `1.2/mixed-and-or`

### 1.3 Pushdown through JOIN
- [x] Push filter on left (fact) table below the JOIN (into the left scan) ← gate: `1.3/push-into-left-scan`
- [x] Push filter on right (dimension) table below the JOIN (into the right scan) ← gate: `1.3/push-into-right-scan`
- [x] Mixed-dataset filters each pushed to their own scan; no FilterNode wraps the JoinNode ← gate: `1.3/cross-dataset-stays-above-join`
- [x] Pushdown is idempotent: applying PushDown twice yields the same tree ← gate: `1.3/pushdown-idempotent`

### 1.4 Pushdown through subquery / CTE
- [x] Push filter into an inline subquery when the predicate references only its output columns ← gate: `1.4/into-subquery`
- [x] Push filter into a CTE definition when the CTE is referenced once and filter is safe ← gate: `1.4/into-cte`

### 1.5 HAVING vs WHERE placement
- [x] Scalar filter on a raw column → emitted as WHERE (pre-aggregate) ← gate: `1.5/where-vs-having`
- [x] Filter on an aggregate result (`revenue > 1000`) → emitted as HAVING (post-aggregate) ← gate: `1.5/where-vs-having`
- [x] Mixed query: scalar filter becomes WHERE, aggregate filter becomes HAVING — both correct ← gate: `1.5/where-vs-having`
- [x] HAVING with `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`, `MIN(...)`, `MAX(...)` rendered correctly ← gate: `1.5/having-aggregate-functions`

---

## 2. JOIN Rewriting

### 2.1 Standard inner / left join
- [x] Single-hop LEFT JOIN between two datasets ← gate: `2.1/single-hop-left`
- [x] Multi-hop LEFT JOIN (A → B → C) via intermediate dataset ← gate: `2.1/multi-hop`
- [x] Join condition rendered as `ON left.col = right.col` (codegen) ← gate: `2.1/on-condition-render`
- [x] Composite join key: multiple ON columns joined with AND ← gate: `2.1/composite-key` (plan), `2.1/composite-key-render` (AND rendering)

### 2.2 Self-join
- [ ] Same dataset joined to itself with distinct aliases (`a AS t1`, `a AS t2`)
- [ ] Self-join with a filter distinguishing the two roles (e.g. parent/child rows)
- [ ] Self-join fan-out detection: SUM/AVG/COUNT over the self-joined table raises error

### 2.3 Semi-join (EXISTS / IN subquery)

Expressed as a **metric filter** — dbt MetricFlow's `Metric('m', group_by=['entity'])`
pattern — rather than EXISTS/IN constructs in the query IR. The filter
`{"metric": "orders.order_count", "group_by": "customers.customer_id", "op": ">", "value": 0}`
renders as a grouped subquery LEFT JOINed on the entity. See `docs/metric-filters.md`.

- [x] Semi-join capability: filter an entity by a related metric (`> 0` ⇒ entities WITH related rows; equivalent to EXISTS) ← gate: `2.3/semi-join-metric-filter`
- [x] IN-subquery semantics (`WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM ...)`) expressed as a metric filter over the related dataset — the semantic-layer form keeps SQL mechanisms out of the IR ← gate: `2.3/semi-join-metric-filter`
- [x] Semi-join does not duplicate left rows when right side has duplicates — the subquery GROUPs BY the entity, so it is one row per entity by construction ← gate: `2.3/semi-join-no-duplication`

### 2.4 Anti-join (NOT EXISTS / NOT IN)
- [x] Anti-join (NOT EXISTS semantics): the same metric filter with `= 0` ⇒ entities WITHOUT related rows ← gate: `2.4/anti-join-metric-filter`
- [x] `NOT IN` subquery alternative unnecessary: one null-safe pattern (LEFT JOIN + COALESCE) serves both dialects and sidesteps NOT IN's NULL trap entirely ← gate: `2.4/null-safe-both-dialects`
- [x] Null-safe anti-join: `COALESCE(metric, 0) = 0` makes the LEFT JOIN's NULLs compare as 0 — null-safe by construction ← gate: `2.4/anti-join-metric-filter`

### 2.5 Fan-out-safe pre-aggregation before JOIN
- [x] SUM metric on the one-side dataset → pre-aggregate before join to avoid fan-out ← gate: `2.5/sum-pre-aggregated`
- [x] AVG metric → pre-aggregate, combine after join (gavagai computes AVG on its own grain, where rows are un-fanned, so no numerator/denominator split is needed) ← gate: `2.5/avg-pre-aggregated`
- [x] Fan-out detection raises `FanOutError` for unsafe metrics when no safe pre-aggregation exists (e.g. many-to-many attribution) ← gate: `2.5/fan-out-detected`, `2.5/fan-out-safe-metric-ok`

---

## 3. Aggregation Rewriting

### 3.1 Basic GROUP BY
- [x] GROUP BY all dimension columns ← gate: `3.1/group-by-dimensions`
- [x] GROUP BY with no dimensions → single-row aggregate (scalar subquery style) ← gate: `3.1/no-dimension-single-row`
- [x] GROUP BY on expression dimension (e.g. `DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)`) ← gate: `3.1/expression-dimension`

### 3.2 COUNT variants
- [x] `COUNT(*)` rendered correctly ← gate: `3.2/count-star-render`
- [x] `COUNT(col)` rendered correctly (excludes NULLs) ← gate: `3.2/count-col-render`
- [x] `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` rendered correctly ← gate: `3.2/count-variants-render`
- [x] `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` across a join (fan-out safe — does not double-count) ← gate: `3.2/count-distinct-safe-across-join`

### 3.3 Aggregate on expression
- [x] `SUM(price * quantity)` — expression inside aggregate rendered verbatim ← gate: `3.3/aggregate-on-expression`
- [x] `AVG(CASE WHEN status = 'complete' THEN amount END)` — conditional aggregate ← gate: `3.3/conditional-aggregate-expression`

### 3.4 Pre-aggregation (push aggregation down)
- [x] Push partial SUM to the inner subquery/CTE, then combine the partials (no outer re-aggregation needed: each grain is summed once in its own subquery) ← gate: `3.4/partial-aggregate-in-subquery`
- [x] Push COUNT DISTINCT into a subquery before joining to avoid over-count ← gate: `3.4/count-distinct-pre-aggregated`
- [ ] Nested aggregation: inner query groups by fine grain, outer by coarse grain (needs a metric-of-metric IR construct)

### 3.5 ROLLUP / CUBE / GROUPING SETS (future, not phase 4)
- [ ] `GROUP BY ROLLUP(a, b)` rendered for dialects that support it
- [ ] `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(...)` rendered correctly

---

## 4. DISTINCT Rewriting

- [x] Top-level `SELECT DISTINCT` when query has no aggregates but dedup is needed ← gate: `4/distinct-render`
- [x] `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` inside aggregate (see §3.2) ← gate: `4/count-distinct-inside-aggregate`
- [ ] DISTINCT pushed below JOIN to reduce cardinality before join
- [x] DISTINCT on multi-column group (composite dedup key) ← gate: `4/distinct-multi-column`
- [x] Rewrite DISTINCT + GROUP BY to GROUP BY only (redundant DISTINCT removed — structural: a measure-bearing query groups and never adds DISTINCT) ← gate: `4/distinct-not-redundant-with-groupby`

---

## 5. LIMIT / OFFSET Pushdown

- [x] LIMIT rendered at top of query ← gate: `5/dialect-limit-syntax`
- [ ] LIMIT pushed into a subquery scan when no JOIN/aggregation is present
- [x] LIMIT NOT pushed below aggregate (result set is already reduced) ← gate: `5/limit-is-outermost`
- [x] LIMIT NOT pushed below JOIN (row count can change) ← gate: `5/limit-is-outermost`
- [x] OFFSET rendered alongside LIMIT when present ← gate: `5/offset`
- [x] Dialect variants: `LIMIT n OFFSET m` — PostgreSQL and BigQuery (the two supported dialects) agree on this form ← gate: `5/dialect-limit-offset-form`

---

## 6. CASE WHEN Rewriting

### 6.1 In dimension expressions
- [x] `CASE WHEN col = 'a' THEN 'label_a' ELSE 'other' END` as a dimension ← gate: `6.1/case-dimension-render`
- [x] Nested CASE WHEN inside a dimension ← gate: `6.1/nested-case-dimension`
- [x] CASE WHEN with IS NULL / IS NOT NULL branches ← gate: `6.1/case-with-null-branch`

### 6.2 In metric expressions
- [x] `SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'complete' THEN amount ELSE 0 END)` — conditional sum ← gate: `6.2/case-metric-render`
- [x] `COUNT(CASE WHEN flag = true THEN 1 END)` — conditional count ← gate: `6.2/case-metric-render`
- [x] `AVG(CASE WHEN ...)` — conditional average ← gate: `6.2/case-metric-render`

### 6.3 In filter predicates
- [x] Filter on a CASE WHEN expression column (dimension filter, not pushed below aggregate) ← gate: `6.3/filter-on-case-dimension`
- [x] CASE WHEN used as a virtual boolean flag in WHERE clause ← gate: `6.3/case-bool-flag-in-where`

### 6.4 COALESCE / NULLIF (related null-handling rewrites)
- [x] `COALESCE(col, default)` in dimension expression ← gate: `6.4/coalesce-nullif`
- [x] `NULLIF(col, 0)` to avoid divide-by-zero in AVG expressions ← gate: `6.4/coalesce-nullif`

---

## 7. Date / Time Grain Rewriting

- [x] `DATE_TRUNC('day', ts)` dimension — PostgreSQL dialect ← gate: `7/date-trunc-postgres`
- [x] `DATE_TRUNC(ts, 'day')` dimension — BigQuery dialect (argument order differs) ← gate: `7/date-trunc-bigquery`
- [x] `DATE_TRUNC('month', ts)` / `'quarter'` / `'year'` ← gate: `7/date-trunc-grains`
- [x] `EXTRACT(DOW FROM ts)` vs `EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM ts)` dialect split ← gate: `7/extract-dow-dialect-split`
- [x] Date arithmetic: `ts + INTERVAL '7 days'` vs `DATE_ADD(ts, INTERVAL 7 DAY)` ← gate: `7/date-arithmetic-dialect-split`
- [x] Timezone conversion: `AT TIME ZONE` (PostgreSQL) vs `DATETIME(ts, tz)` (BigQuery) ← gate: `7/timezone-dialect-split`

---

## 8. Subquery and CTE Strategy

- [x] Inline subquery: single-use derived table emitted as `(SELECT ...) AS alias` ← gate: `8/inline-subquery`
- [x] CTE: multi-use or recursive tables emitted as `WITH alias AS (SELECT ...)` ← gate: `8/cte`
- [x] CTE vs subquery selection: use CTE when the same logical table is referenced >1 time ← gate: `8/cte-vs-subquery-choice`
- [x] Nested CTEs: CTE that references another CTE ← gate: `8/nested-cte`
- [ ] Recursive CTE: hierarchical / graph traversal (future)
- [x] Push predicates into CTE body when the CTE is used exactly once ← gate: `8/push-predicate-into-cte`

---

## 9. NULL Handling Rewrites

- [x] `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` predicates (see §1.1) ← gate: `9/is-null-predicate`
- [x] LEFT JOIN null check (`WHERE right.id IS NULL` → anti-join pattern): realized as a NULL-generating LEFT JOIN to a grouped subquery with the null-safe `COALESCE(metric, 0) = 0` check ← gate: `9/anti-join-null-check`
- [ ] `COALESCE` to replace NULL with a default in GROUP BY key (avoid null-group splitting)
- [x] `COUNT(col)` excludes NULLs — contrast with `COUNT(*)` in test ← gate: `9/count-col-excludes-null`
- [ ] NULL-safe equality: `col IS NOT DISTINCT FROM value` (PostgreSQL) vs `col <=> value` (MySQL)

---

## 10. Window Function Rewrites (future — post phase 4)

- [ ] `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)` as a dimension
- [ ] `RANK()` / `DENSE_RANK()` window dimensions
- [ ] Running SUM: `SUM(col) OVER (ORDER BY ts ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)`
- [ ] Moving average: `AVG(col) OVER (ORDER BY ts ROWS 6 PRECEDING)`
- [ ] Pushdown: filter on window function result → must be in outer query, not pushed down

---

## 11. Dialect-Specific Rewrites

### 11.1 Identifier quoting
- [x] PostgreSQL: double-quote identifiers (`"orders"."customer_id"`) ← gate: `11/identifier-quoting`
- [x] BigQuery: backtick identifiers (`` `orders`.`customer_id` ``) ← gate: `11/bigquery-backtick-quoting`, `11/dialect-divergence`
- [x] Project/dataset prefix in BigQuery table refs: `my_project.analytics.orders` ← gate: bigquery `TestBackquoteQuoting` + golden files

### 11.2 String functions
- [x] `CONCAT(a, b)` vs `a || b` (PostgreSQL / ANSI) ← gate: `11/casts-and-string-fns`
- [x] `UPPER` / `LOWER` — same across dialects (no rewrite needed, verify) ← gate: `11/casts-and-string-fns`

### 11.3 Boolean literals
- [x] PostgreSQL: `TRUE` / `FALSE` ← gate: `11/casts-and-string-fns`
- [x] BigQuery: `TRUE` / `FALSE` (same — no rewrite, verify test) ← gate: `11/casts-and-string-fns`

### 11.4 Type casts
- [x] `CAST(col AS INT64)` BigQuery vs `CAST(col AS INTEGER)` PostgreSQL ← gate: `11/casts-and-string-fns`
- [x] `col::integer` PostgreSQL shorthand — not valid in BigQuery ← gate: `11/casts-and-string-fns`

### 11.5 LIMIT syntax (see §5)

### 11.6 Array / UNNEST
- [ ] `UNNEST(array_col)` as a lateral join source (BigQuery: `CROSS JOIN UNNEST(...)`)
- [ ] `UNNEST` with ordinality (PostgreSQL: `WITH ORDINALITY`)

---

## 12. Expression Passthrough

- [x] Metric expression rendered verbatim from OSI dialect entry when available ← gate: `12/verbatim-target-dialect`
- [x] Fallback: `ANSI_SQL` dialect expression used when no target-dialect entry exists ← gate: `12/ansi-fallback`
- [x] Error raised when no expression is available for the target dialect and no ANSI_SQL fallback ← gate: `12/missing-dialect-error`
- [x] Dimension field expression rendered correctly (not just column name) ← gate: `12/verbatim-target-dialect`
- [ ] Nested expression: expression references another field expression by name (future)

---

## 13. ORDER BY Rewrites

- [x] `ORDER BY col ASC` / `ORDER BY col DESC` ← gate: `13/directions-and-default`
- [x] `ORDER BY` on a metric alias (post-aggregate reference) ← gate: `13/directions-and-default`
- [x] `ORDER BY` on a dimension expression (must match GROUP BY expression exactly) ← gate: `13/directions-and-default` (alias form)
- [x] `NULLS FIRST` / `NULLS LAST` — supported natively by both PostgreSQL and BigQuery ← gate: `13/nulls-first-last`
- [x] Multiple ORDER BY columns with mixed directions ← gate: `13/directions-and-default`

---

## 14. Miscellaneous Safety Rules

- [x] No cartesian product: error if two datasets have no join path and are both referenced ← gate: `14/no-cartesian-product`
- [x] Ambiguous column: when the same bare column exists in multiple joined datasets, the planner qualifies each reference to its own dataset (`"customers"."region"`) and disambiguates colliding output aliases — emitting unambiguous SQL rather than rejecting the query ← gate: `14/ambiguous-column-qualified`, `14/ambiguous-column-single-qualified`
- [x] Cyclic join path: BFS handles cycles (already visited nodes skipped), verify no infinite loop ← gate: `14/cyclic-join-path-terminates`
- [x] Empty result set guard: queries with always-false predicates still produce valid SQL (no special casing) ← gate: `14/empty-result-guard`
- [x] Integer overflow: LIMIT value fits in dialect's integer type (both targets accept 64-bit LIMIT) ← gate: `14/limit-fits-dialect-integer`
